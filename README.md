```bash
cd dayXX
python solution.py
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Standard library modules:
  - collections
  - itertools
  - math
  - re
  - ...

## 📝 Notes

- Each day's directory contains:
  - The puzzle input (`input.txt`)
  - The solution code (`solution.py`)
  - A markdown with notes about the approach and any interesting observations

## 🌟 Personal Goals

- [ ] Complete all 25 days
